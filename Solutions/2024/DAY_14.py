"""
Advent of Code 2024 - Day 14

This script contains my solution for **Advent of Code 2024, Day 14**. 
Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl, designed to challenge problem-solving skills and programming techniques. 
You can find more information about Advent of Code here: https://adventofcode.com

## Usage:
- Run the script with a standard Python interpreter.
- Input data should be provided in the form of a text file named `day_14_input.txt` located in the same directory as this script.
- Example: `python DAY_14.py`

## Credits:
- **Puzzle Design**: Eric Wastl (Advent of Code creator).
- **Solution Author**: Wojciech KoÅ›nik-Kowalczuk - I developed this solution as part of my personal journey through Advent of Code.
- **Special Thanks**: To the global Advent of Code community for sharing insights and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Notes:
- Optimization opportunities might exist and will be revisited as time permits.
- Feel free to reach out with feedback, suggestions, or optimizations for this solution.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

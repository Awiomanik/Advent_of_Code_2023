Advent of Code 2024 - Day 13

This script contains my solution for **Advent of Code 2024, Day 13**. 
Advent of Code is an annual set of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl, designed to challenge problem-solving skills and programming techniques. 
You can find more information about Advent of Code here: https://adventofcode.com

## Usage:
- Run the script with a standard Python interpreter.
- Input data should be provided in the form of a text file named `day_13_input.txt` located in the same directory as this script.
- Example: `python DAY_13.py`

## Credits:
- **Puzzle Design**: Eric Wastl (Advent of Code creator).
- **Solution Author**: Wojciech KoÅ›nik-Kowalczuk - I developed this solution as part of my personal journey through Advent of Code.
- **Special Thanks**: To the global Advent of Code community for sharing insights and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Notes:
- Optimization opportunities might exist and will be revisited as time permits.
- Feel free to reach out with feedback, suggestions, or optimizations for this solution.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

    #
    # where Am and Bm are the unknowns.

    # Ax * Am = x - Bx * Bm
    # Am = (x - Bx * Bm) / Ax

    # From that, we can obtain the Bm component:

    # y * Ax = Ay * x - Bx * Bm * Ay + By * Bm * Ax

    # y = Ay * Am + By * Bm
    # Ay * Am = y - By * Bm

# FINAL SOLUTION
def final_solution_for_year_2023_omg_nice_we_did_it_guys():
    '''
    In the last task this year I did not find some super creative solution,
    I was adheard to the original (quite brute-forcy) idea of cutting subsequent triplets of wires
    and checking if the graph is still connected and to three simple rules: optimize, optimize, optimize!
    Somehow I managed to get the solution in under a secound, which is not bad at all.
    Thank you for reading this code and I hope you enjoyed the adventure as much as I did!
    See you next year, WKK.
